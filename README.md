# E-commerce-product-recommendation
This E-Commerce Product Recommendation System suggests relevant products to users using both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. It analyzes product descriptions and user behavior to deliver personalized recommendations through a normal E-commerce style interactive Gradio UI.
Sure! Here's a clean and professional **README description** for your E-Commerce Product Recommendation System:

# preview

This project is a Flipkart-style Product Recommendation Engine built using Python and Gradio. It combines **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to suggest relevant products to users based on:

- **Product features (description similarity)**
- **User preferences (similar user behavior)**

The system uses **TF-IDF** for analyzing product descriptions and a **user-product rating matrix** for collaborative filtering. The UI is designed using **Gradio** to simulate a simple and modern e-commerce experience.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 **Content-Based Recommendations**  
  Suggest similar products based on selected item descriptions.

- 👥 **Collaborative Filtering**  
  Suggest products by analyzing similar user behavior and preferences.

- 💻 **Gradio Interface**  
  User-friendly UI mimicking Flipkart-style product cards with images and details.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python
- Gradio
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Cosine Similarity (for both users and products)

## 🚀 How to Run (on Google Colab)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install gradio scikit-learn
   ```

2. Paste the full code block in a Colab cell.

3. Launch and interact via the provided Gradio link.

## 📁 Dataset (Sample)

- A mini dataset of products with titles, descriptions, and images
- Sample user-product rating matrix for demo purposes

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Real-time API integration with e-commerce platforms
- User login and preferences persistence
- Advanced recommendation algorithms (XGBoost, Deep Learning)
